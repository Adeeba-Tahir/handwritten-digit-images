# handwritten-digit-images

This project focuses on generating handwritten digit images using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).

The process involves two main components that train simultaneously:

## Generator:
This model takes random noise as input and learns to create new handwritten digit images.

## Discriminator:
This model acts as a "critic," learning to distinguish between real handwritten digit images (from the MNIST dataset) and the fake images produced by the generator.


During the training, the generator tries to create increasingly realistic images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator improves its ability to identify fake images. This adversarial process helps both models improve over time. As the training progresses, the generated digits gradually transform from random noise into images that closely resemble actual handwritten digits.

This project serves as a practical example of how GANs can be used for image synthesis and showcases the iterative learning process of adversarial networks
